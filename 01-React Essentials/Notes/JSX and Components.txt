Why use JSX?

JSX lets us write UI markup and JavaScript logic together in a single file. It makes components easier to read, maintain, and understand because everything related to the UI part lives in one place.

Why use Components?

Components break the UI into small, reusable, and isolated pieces. Each component contains its own HTML, logic, and styling, making the application modular and easy to manage.
